# To have Prometheus retrieve metrics from Kubelets with authentication and
# authorization enabled (which is highly recommended and included in security
# benchmarks) the following flags must be set on the kubelet(s):
#
# --authentication-token-webhook
# --authorization-mode=Webhook
#
# NOTE: Change namespace values to correspond your working namespace for Prometheus
